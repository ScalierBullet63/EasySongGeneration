## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. **Extract the Archive**

   - Unzip the `.7z` archive to a folder of your choice.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: To avoid extraction errors, make sure you‚Äôve installed the latest version of [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) before opening the archive.

2. **Clone the Model Repository**

   - Make sure you have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) installed.
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://huggingface.co/tencent/SongGeneration
     ```
   - Copy the following folders from the cloned repo into the **root** of the extracted folder:
     - `ckpt`
     - `third_party`

3. **Disable Flash Attention**

   - Open the file:
     ```
     ckpt\songgeneration_base\config.yaml
     ```
   - Go to **line 39** and change:
     ```yaml
     use_flash_attn_2: true
     ```
     to:
     ```yaml
     use_flash_attn_2: false
     ```
   - This disables Flash Attention, which may cause issues on some systems.

4. **Run the Application**
   - In the root folder, execute the following command:
     ```bash
     .\tools\gradio\run_embedded.bat .\ckpt\songgeneration_base\
     ```
